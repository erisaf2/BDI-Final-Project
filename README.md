# COVID-19 Independent Case Study

This is an independent final project I've performed for BDI 475 - Introduction to Data Analytics Applications in Business.

I chose the COVID-19 Dataset in order to compare COVID cases at the height of the Pandemic in the US on Jan 8, 2021 versus April 30, 2021. I'm curious to see how the US has improved after the vaccine has been rolled out and fully administered to over 30% of the population, as of May 2, 2021. This data includes the 50 states, US Territories and two cruise ships that had the initial large COVID outbreaks, Diamond Princess and Grand Princess.
